        <p>TheStreet Ratings' stock model projects a stock's total return potential over a 12-month period including
            both price
            appreciation and dividends. Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to perform
            against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest rates.
            While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both subjective and objective elements. For instance,
            subjective elements include expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry
            outlook and forecasted company earnings.
            Objective elements include volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash
            flows.</p><br>
        <p>Our model guages the relationship between risk and reward in several ways, including: the pricing drawdown as
            ocmpared to potential profit volatility,
            i.e. how much one is willing to risk in order to earn profits; the level of acceptable volatility for highly
            performing stocks; the current valuation as compared to projected earnings growth; and the financial
            strength of the underlying company as compared to its stock's
            valuation as compared to its stock's performance. These and many more derived observations are then
            combined, ranked, weighted, and scenario-tested to create a more complete analysis. The result is a
            systematic and disciplined method of selecting stocks.</p>
